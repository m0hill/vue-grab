# Contributing to Vue Grab

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Vue Grab! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/m0hill/vue-grab/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **pnpm**: v8 or higher

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vue-grab.git
cd vue-grab
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will watch for changes in the `packages/vue-grab` package and rebuild automatically.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed by pnpm workspaces:

```
vue-grab/
├── packages/
│   ├── vue-grab/        # Main library package
│   ├── kitchen-sink/    # Vue 3 demo application
│   └── vue2-demo/       # Vue 2.7 demo application
├── .github/             # GitHub workflows and configs
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml  # Workspace configuration
```

### Key Packages

- **`packages/vue-grab`**: The main library code
  - `src/index.ts`: Main entry point
  - `src/instrumentation.ts`: Core instrumentation logic
  - `src/adapters.ts`: Adapter implementations
  - `src/plugins/vite.ts`: Vite plugin
  - `src/overlay.ts`: Overlay UI
  - `src/hotkeys.ts`: Keyboard shortcuts

- **`packages/kitchen-sink`**: Vue 3 demo application for testing

- **`packages/vue2-demo`**: Vue 2.7 demo application (Options & Composition API)

## Development Workflow

### Building

Build the main package:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Linting

Run linter:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Auto-fix linting issues:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

### Formatting

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Check formatting and linting:

```bash
pnpm check
```

### Testing

Test your changes by running the demo apps:

**Vue 3 (kitchen-sink):**

```bash
cd packages/kitchen-sink
pnpm dev
```

**Vue 2.7 (vue2-demo):**

```bash
cd packages/vue2-demo
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser and test the functionality by holding <kbd>⌘C</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> on Windows/Linux) for 500ms, then hovering and clicking elements.

## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
feat: add support for custom hotkeys
fix: resolve overlay positioning issue
docs: update installation guide
```

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Code Style

We follow these guidelines:

- Use **TypeScript** for all code
- Use **arrow functions** over function declarations
- Use **interfaces** over types
- Use **descriptive variable names** (avoid abbreviations)
- **Remove unused code** and avoid repetition
- Add comments only when necessary (prefix hacks with `// HACK:`)
- Use **kebab-case** for filenames

Example:

```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  enableOverlay: boolean;
  hotkey: string;
}

const getUserPreferences = (): UserPreferences => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Before Submitting

1. **Run tests**: Ensure the kitchen-sink demo works
2. **Run linter**: `pnpm check`
3. **Format code**: `pnpm format`
4. **Build successfully**: `pnpm build`
5. **Test in multiple browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
